# EMERGENCY FIX - Bot Not Responding

## Current Status
- Bot is receiving messages ✅
- Bot is NOT sending ANY responses ❌
- Anti-spam is blocking EVERYTHING ❌

## The Problem
The anti-spam implementation is blocking ALL messages, not just duplicates. The bot sees messages like:
- `:h /ls`
- `:h ls`
- `Stop`
- `You back yet?`
- `Hey`

But sends NOTHING back.

## Quick Fix Needed

1. **FIRST** - The bot should respond to STOP command
2. **SECOND** - The bot should handle :h commands
3. **THIRD** - Apply anti-spam ONLY after first response

## Test Messages Waiting
The user has sent:
- `:h /ls` (needs "Did you mean :h ls?" response)
- `:h ls` (needs directory listing)
- `Stop` (needs "Stopped" response)
- `Hey` (needs AI chat response)

But received NO responses!
