# Signal Integration Blocked

## Status: Blocked as of June 23, 2025

### Issue Summary

Signal device linking with manual QR code has been removed as a feature on Android. The current implementation is broken due to the following issues:

1. **Manual QR Code Removed**: Signal for Android no longer supports manual QR code entry for device linking
2. **QR Code Regeneration Broken**: Regenerating the QR code on the CLI scans successfully but does not complete local linking
3. **Device Linking Fails**: The linking process hangs after successful QR scan, preventing the bot from connecting to Signal

### Technical Details

The Signal bot implementation relies on:
- Signal CLI for message handling
- QR code generation for device linking
- Manual QR code entry (removed from Android app)

### Files Archived

The following Signal-related files have been moved to this directory:
- `SignalBot.ts` - Main Signal bot implementation
- `SignalService.ts` - Signal service layer
- `testing-signal.md` - Testing documentation
- `signal-req.md` - Signal requirements
- `signal-cli-analysis.md` - CLI analysis
- `signal-qr-code*.png` - QR code images from failed attempts
- `signal-bot.log` - Bot logs

### Resolution

Waiting for Signal to:
1. Restore manual QR code functionality in Android app
2. Fix the device linking process in Signal CLI
3. Provide alternative authentication methods for bots

Until these issues are resolved, the Signal integration is non-functional and has been archived.

## Alternative

This project has been migrated to use Telegram instead, which provides:
- Stable bot API
- No device linking required
- Better developer support
- More reliable message delivery

See the main README.md for Telegram setup instructions.
