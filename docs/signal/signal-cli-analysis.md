# signal-cli Analysis & Potential Issues

## Overview
signal-cli is an unofficial command-line Signal client for sending and receiving messages. Based on analysis of the official README, here are key findings:

## ‚úÖ Key Requirements Met
- **Java 21+**: Required runtime environment
- **libsignal-client**: Native library (bundled for major platforms)
- **Phone number**: SMS/call verification needed
- **Docker support**: Available via `bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings & Limitations

### 1. Maintenance Requirements
- **Regular updates mandatory**: "signal-cli releases older than three months may not work correctly"
- **Breaking changes**: Frequent Signal server updates require client updates
- **Unofficial implementation**: Not maintained by Signal Foundation

### 2. Platform Compatibility Issues
**Native libraries only bundled for:**
- ‚úÖ x86_64 Linux (recent glibc)
- ‚úÖ Windows
- ‚úÖ macOS
- ‚ùå ARM64 Linux (including Raspberry Pi)
- ‚ùå Other architectures

### 3. Registration Challenges
- **CAPTCHA solving**: May be required during registration
- **Landline registration**: Special procedures needed
- **Rate limiting**: Signal may block registration attempts

### 4. Operational Limitations
- **Server-side focus**: Primarily designed for notifications, not interactive chat
- **Encryption maintenance**: Requires regular message receiving for proper encryption
- **No audio/video calls**: Text messaging only

## üê≥ Docker Deployment Analysis

### Current Setup Status
Our `docker-compose.yml` now correctly references:
```yaml
services:
  signal-cli:
    image: bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api:latest
    container_name: signal-cli-service
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

### Docker Benefits
- ‚úÖ Pre-configured environment
- ‚úÖ Automatic dependency management
- ‚úÖ REST API interface
- ‚úÖ Regular image updates

### Docker Concerns
- **Image maintenance**: Depends on third-party maintainer
- **Version lag**: Docker image may not match latest signal-cli
- **Platform support**: Limited to supported architectures

## üç∫ Local Installation (Homebrew)

### Installation Attempt Results
```bash
brew install signal-cli
# Error: signal-cli: no bottle available!
# Requires: brew install --build-from-source signal-cli
```

### Issues Encountered
- **No pre-compiled bottles**: Must build from source
- **Long build time**: 2+ minutes with heavy dependencies
- **Tier 3 support**: Limited Homebrew support

### Dependencies Required
- openjdk@21, gradle, protobuf, rust, llvm, cmake, python@3.13

## üîß Practical Deployment Recommendations

### For Development
1. **Use Docker**: `docker-compose up signal-cli`
2. **Link existing phone**: Avoid new number registration
3. **Test locally**: Before production deployment

### For Production
1. **Monitor updates**: Set up automated image pulls
2. **Health checks**: Already configured in docker-compose
3. **Backup strategy**: Persistent volume for signal-data

### For SaaS Hosting
1. **Multi-region concerns**: Architecture limitations
2. **Auto-scaling**: May break encryption state
3. **Phone number management**: Each instance needs unique number

## üö® Potential Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Mitigation |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Outdated versions break | High | Automated updates |
| Platform compatibility | Medium | Use Docker |
| Registration blocks | Medium | Device linking preferred |
| Build complexity | Low | Use pre-built images |
| Unofficial status | Low | Monitor Signal changes |

## üì± Audio Call Capability Analysis

### Current Status: ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED
signal-cli is **text-only** and does not support:
- Voice calls
- Video calls
- Audio messages
- File attachments (limited)

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Signal Desktop**: GUI application with call support
2. **libsignal-service**: Direct protocol implementation
3. **Third-party solutions**: None maintain call functionality

### Technical Barriers
- **WebRTC complexity**: Voice/video requires real-time protocols
- **Signal protocol**: Proprietary call signaling
- **Resource intensive**: Audio processing needs significant CPU/bandwidth
- **Security concerns**: Voice calls require additional encryption layers

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Use Docker for signal-cli deployment
2. ‚úÖ Implement device linking over new registration
3. ‚úÖ Set up automated health monitoring
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Plan for regular updates (monthly minimum)

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Audio calls**: Not feasible with current signal-cli
2. **Scaling**: Limited by Signal's architecture
3. **Reliability**: Unofficial status presents ongoing risk
4. **Alternatives**: Consider Telegram Bot API for more features

**Bottom Line**: signal-cli works well for text messaging bots but requires active maintenance and has architectural limitations for advanced features like audio calls.
